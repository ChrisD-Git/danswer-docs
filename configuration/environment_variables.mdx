## Environment Variables 

This is an extensive list of the currently supported environment variables within Danswer. There are several classes of environment variables. All of the global configuration options that are not built into the UI are set via environment variables.


You can set these in your `.env` file.


## Auth Settings

<Note>

`disabled`: No authentication is required.

`google_oauth`: Users can log in using their Google accounts.

#### MAX_CHUNKS_FED_TO_CHAT
Maximum number of document chunks fed into a single chat session.

#### DISABLE_LLM_FILTER_EXTRACTION
Set to `true` to disable LLM-based filter extraction from queries.

#### DISABLE_LLM_CHUNK_FILTER
Set to `true` to disable LLM-based filtering of document chunks.

#### DISABLE_LLM_CHOOSE_SEARCH
Set to `true` to disable LLM-based selection of search method.

#### DISABLE_LLM_QUERY_REPHRASE
Set to `true` to disable LLM-based query rephrasing.

#### LITELLM_EXTRA_HEADERS
JSON-formatted string of key-value pairs for additional headers in LiteLLM API requests.

#### TOKEN_BUDGET_GLOBALLY_ENABLED

#### AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS secret access key for Bedrock access, obtained from AWS IAM. Keep this value secret.

#### AWS_REGION_NAME
AWS region where Bedrock is deployed (e.g., `us-west-2`).

## Query Options
These variables control various aspects of query processing and search behavior.

#### DOC_TIME_DECAY

## ENV_SEED_CONFIGURATION  
If you want to start your instance of Danswer with pre-configured options, you can use environment variables to seed it 
with pre-specified options. These will persist across restarts, shut-down of volumes, etc.

- `llms`: a list of llm configurations 
  - Each item in the list should contain: `name`, `provider`, `api_key`, `api_base`, `api_version`, `custom_config`, `default_model_name`, `fast_default_model_name` 
- `admin_user_emails`: a list of email addresses which, upon signing up, should automatically be assigned admin roles.
- `seeded_name`: pre-set name for your company's Danswer instance (e.g. "Acme's Danswer").
- `seeded_logo_path`: pre-set path to your logo (as seen from the perspective of the `backend` repository). This should point to a path within `assets` (the folder within `/backend`) (e.g. `assets/logo.png`)

Example configuration: `export ENV_SEED_CONFIGURATION='{"admin_user_emails": ["email@gmail.com"], "seeded_name": "Acme Corp", "seeded_logo_path": "assets/logo.png"}'`
