## Environment Variables
All of the global configuration options that are not built into the UI are set via environment variables.
A fairly exhaustive list of all of the options can be found
[here](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/deployment/docker_compose/docker-compose.dev.yml#L18).

There are defaults set in the code so changing/settings these values is **not required** to use Danswer.
A few notable settings that are more frequently changed however are the following:
- AUTH_TYPE (default value is `disabled`)
- MULTILINGUAL_QUERY_EXPANSION (you can provide a comma separated list of languages for query rephrasing such as `English,French`)
- LOG_LEVEL (default is `info`)
- WEB_DOMAIN (your full url in production, including the protocol- e.g. https://www.danswer.ai)

class LLMProviderUpsertRequest(LLMProvider):
    # should only be used for a "custom" provider
    # for default providers, the built-in model names are used
    model_names: list[str] | None

## Seeding
If you want to start your instance of Danswer with pre-configured options, you can use environment variables to seed it 
with pre-specified options. These will persist across restarts, shut-down of volumes, etc.

- `llms`: a list of llm configurations 
  - Each item in the list should contain: `name`, `provider`, `api_key`, `api_base`, `api_version`, `custom_config`, `default_model_name`, `fast_default_model_name` 
- `admin_user_emails`: a list of email addresses which, upon signing up, should automatically be assigned admin roles. 
- `seeded_name`: pre-set name for your company's Danswer instance (e.g. "Acme's Danswer").
- `seeded_logo_path`: pre-set path to your logo (as seen from the perspective of the `backend` repository). This should point to a path within `assets` (e.g. `assets/logo.png`)

## Docker Compose
There are several ways to configure environment variables for the containers. For Docker Compose, there are many ways
to pass environment variables to the container, any of the standard approaches will work. However
**the preferred approach** for Danswer is to use the `.env` file. To do this, create a file called `.env` at
`danswer/deployment/docker_compose/.env`. From there, populate it with the values you want to override:

```
# Configures basic email/password based login
AUTH_TYPE="basic"

# Rephrasing the query into different languages to improve search recall
MULTILINGUAL_QUERY_EXPANSION="English,Spanish,German"

# Set a cheaper/faster LLM for the flows that are easier (such as translating the query etc.)
FAST_GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION="gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Setting more verbose logging
LOG_LEVEL="debug"
LOG_ALL_MODEL_INTERACTIONS="true"
```


# Kubernetes
For Kubernetes, the deployment yaml files includes an Environment ConfigMap. Simply update the values in the file
[here](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/deployment/kubernetes/env-configmap.yaml).
