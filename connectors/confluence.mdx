## How it works
The Confluence connector pulls in all pages and comments from the specified spaces/pages every 10 minutes.

## Setting up
### Authorization
    1. Follow the guide described [here](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/Atlassian-Jira-Confluence-Authentication-Create-API-Token.htm) to get an access token.

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Confluence** Connector
    2. In **Step 1**, provide the **Access Token** and the **Username** (typically an email) it belongs to:

![ConfluenceConnector](/images/connectors/confluence/ConfluenceAuth.png)

    3. Next, insert a link to a space/page. If the provided link is for a Confluence space, the entire space will be indexed.<br /> 
       E.g., entering `https://danswer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Engineering/overview` will index the entire Engineering Confluence space whereas entering<br /> 
       `https://danswer.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Engineering/pages/164331/example+page` will index that page.<br /> 
       Selecting the "Index Recursively" checkbox will index the single page's children in addition to itself.

    4. Click the `Connect` button! All the specified spaces/pages and related comments will now be pulled into Danswer every **10** minutes.
