## How it works
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Storage connector pulls in all documents from the specified OCI bucket. It supports various file formats including PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, and more.

Documents are updated every **10** minutes.

## Setting up

### Authorization

1. Log into your Oracle Cloud Console.
2. Click on the user icon in the top-right corner and select "User Settings".

6. Click "Add" to add the public key to your account.

## Understanding Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Structure

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage organizes data into buckets. Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects (files). You can think of a bucket as a root directory, and the objects as files within that directory.

For more information on OCI Object Storage structure, visit the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Concepts/objectstorageoverview.htm).
