Documents are updated every **10** minutes.

4. Click "Create API token".
5. Give your token a name (e.g., "DanswerR2Connector") and select the appropriate permissions (read access to your bucket).
6. Click "Create API Token".

## Understanding R2 Structure

Cloudflare R2 organizes data into buckets, similar to Amazon S3. Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects (files). You can think of a bucket as a root directory, and the objects as files within that directory.
