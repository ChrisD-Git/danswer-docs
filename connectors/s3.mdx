## How it works
The S3 connector pulls in all documents from the specified Amazon S3 bucket. It supports various file formats including PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, and more.

Documents are updated every **10** minutes.

## Setting up

### Authorization

1. Log into your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Users" and then "Add user".
4. Set a name for the new user (e.g., "DanswerS3Connector") and select "Programmatic access".
5. Click "Next: Permissions".
6. Choose "Attach existing policies directly" and search for "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess".
7. Select this policy and click "Next: Tags".
8. Add any tags if needed, then click "Next: Review".
9. Review the details and click "Create user".
10. On the success page, you'll see the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Make sure to copy these immediately as you won't be able to access the Secret Access Key again.

## Understanding S3 Structure

Amazon S3 organizes data into buckets. Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects (files). You can think of a bucket as a root directory, and the objects as files within that directory.

For more information on S3 structure, visit the [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).
