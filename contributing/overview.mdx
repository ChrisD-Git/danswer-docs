### Contribution Opportunities
The [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/issues) page is a great place to start for contribution ideas.

Issues that have been explicitly approved by the maintainers (aligned with the direction of the project)
will be marked with the `approved by maintainers` label.
Issues marked `good first issue` are an especially great place to start.

**Connectors** to other tools are another great place to contribute. For details on how, refer to this
[README.md](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/danswer/connectors/README.md).

If you have a new/different contribution in mind, we'd love to hear about it!
Your input is vital to making sure that Danswer moves in the right direction.
Before starting on implementation, please raise a GitHub issue.
